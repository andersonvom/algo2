## The Knapsack Problem

Maximize the total value `V` of objects with weight `W` put in a knapsack of capacity `C`.

### Input

A list of object values and weights. There are two positive integers `C` and `N` on the first line standing for the capacity and number of items, respectively. Then there are `N` lines , each containing exactly two positive integers `V` (value), and `W` (weight) of each object. All numbers are positive and integers.

### Output

The maximum value of the objects that can fit the knapsack.
